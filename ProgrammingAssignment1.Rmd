setInternet2(use = TRUE) # necessary under windows to download files when using knitr
download.file(fURL, destfile='activity.zip') # add " method='curl' " if downloading fails
unzip('activity.zip')

#Process/transform the data (if necessary) into a format suitable for your analysis

activity$date <- as.Date(activity$date, format= "%Y-%m-%d")

#Calculate th total number of steps taken per day

#The mean  of total number of steps <!--rinline meanByDay --> and the median is <!-- rinline medianByDay --> 

##What is the average daily activity pattern?
#Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

#Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.

#Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.
#replace the NAs with avg value over all days of respective interval
