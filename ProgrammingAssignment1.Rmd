##Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
#For this part the weekdays() function may be of some help here. Use the dataset with the filled-in missing values for this part.
#Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels - "weekday" and "weekend" indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

See the README file in the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like using simulated data.
